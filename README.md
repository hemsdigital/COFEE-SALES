  ## Data Cleaning/ Transformation
   In the beginning of Data Preparation Phase, the following tasks were performed.
  
  1.  A column for Revenue was added using operator =D2*H2.
  2.  A column for month was added using =TEXT(B2,"mm")
  3.  A column for monthName was added =TEXT(B2,"mmm")
  4.  A column for weekday was added using =WEEKDAY(B2,2)
  5.  A column for WeekDay Name was added using =TEXT(B2,"DDDD")
  6.  A column for Hour using =HOUR(C2)

## Recommendations
- I recommend that Focus will be  on promoting the top-selling item like coffee and teas.
- Give discounts on these top selling products during peak hours to attract more customerss.
- The data shows early morning hours, particularly around 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM, as high-traffic times. Provide adequate 
  staffing during these peak hours to handle the increased customer flow efficiently.
- To bring traffic during low-peak hours, consider introducing time-limited offers or discounts. Introduce more 
  varities, new flavors and seasonal teas to attract tea enthusiasts.
- Make sure popular products are always available.
- Always train staff on good service techniques and product knowledge to improve customer experience and speed up 
  service.
- Make constant Adverts and posts on social media platforms to showcase new products. Also, engage with customer 
  regularly through stories and feedback polls. Introduction of high and efficient marketing strategies in those low- 
  peak sales areas.
-  Allow customers to customize their drinks like add extra shots, choose milk alternatives e.t.c to cater 
  to diverse preferences and highlight these options on the menu.
- Implement a customer loyalty programs where frequent buyers can accumulate points for discounts or free items. This 
  can encourage repeat business and increase customer retention.
  By implementing these recommendations and insights, the business can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and ultimately increase revenue.
